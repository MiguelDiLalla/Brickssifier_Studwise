# LEGO Bricks ML Vision

A machine learning project for detecting and classifying LEGO bricks through computer vision.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow for LEGO brick detection and classification:

1. **Brick Detection**: Identifying LEGO bricks in images using YOLOv8
2. **Stud Detection**: Locating individual studs on detected bricks
3. **Dimension Classification**: Determining brick dimensions (e.g., 2x4) based on stud patterns

## Key Features

- Complete ML pipeline from dataset preparation to inference
- Multiple detection models (bricks and studs)
- Command-line interface for all operations
- Rich metadata handling with EXIF storage
- Professional logging and error handling
- Visualization tools for model results

## Technical Components

- **Training Pipeline**: Custom training process for YOLO models
- **Inference Engine**: Optimized detection and classification system
- **Dataset Utilities**: Tools for converting annotations between formats
- **CLI Tools**: User-friendly command-line interface

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LEGO_Bricks_ML_Vision.git
cd LEGO_Bricks_ML_Vision

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage Examples

Train a model:
```bash
python lego_cli.py train --mode bricks --epochs 20
```

Run inference on an image:
```bash
python lego_cli.py infer --images path/to/image.jpg
```

Process dataset annotations:
```bash
python lego_cli.py data-processing labelme-to-yolo --input path/to/json --output path/to/output
```
