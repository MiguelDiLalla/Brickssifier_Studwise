### 🌍 **Background**  
Born in Caracas in 1998, Miguel belongs to a generation shaped by both the digital revolution and Latin American uncertainty. After three years studying Metallurgical Engineering at the Central University of Venezuela, he emigrated to Spain seeking growth. What began as a visit to Tenerife became the beginning of his adult life.  

Starting in hospitality, he gained financial independence, improved his English, and strengthened his emotional intelligence through constant interaction with people from around the world.  

> *"Hospitality taught me how to manage stress—and the value of emotional intelligence."*

### 📚 **Lifelong Learner**  
Miguel never stopped learning. Drawn to technical, philosophical, and scientific thought since childhood, he had always been the kind of student who walked into class saying: *“Did you know…?”*  

Originally aspiring to study Physics or Psychology, he eventually chose Materials Engineering to understand the inner workings of the physical world.  

> *"The classroom has always been my habitat. It’s where I breathe best."*  

When traditional education paused, Miguel built his own path—immersing himself in self-guided study. Using platforms like Coursera, GitHub, YouTube, and tools like ChatGPT Plus and GitHub Copilot Pro, he transformed his curiosity into technical capability. Language models became his mentors, helping him test ideas, solve problems, and refine his learning.  

> *"I study with the tools of the future to earn my place in the present."*

### 🔧 **Flagship Project: LEGO Bricks ML Vision**  
Miguel’s learning journey culminated in a standout project: **LEGO Bricks ML Vision**, a computer vision system that identifies and classifies LEGO bricks from images.  

> *"If I can recognize a LEGO piece instantly, can a machine learn to do the same?"*  

Built entirely from scratch, the system integrates YOLOv8 object detection, stud-based keypoint logic, and dimension prediction. Miguel added thoughtful touches—like a CLI with clean UX, visual annotations, and dynamic EXIF outputs—showcasing both engineering skill and user empathy.  

> *"Every ML model begins like a sketch: an idea, a draft, a thousand mistakes—and finally, a solution that breathes."*

### 🚀 **Current Opportunity**  
Miguel is currently part of **PONOS**, a youth employment initiative that funds three-month roles in local companies. This allows any employer to trial his skills with zero onboarding risk—and discover a grounded, fast-learning developer ready to grow.  

> *"What I offer isn’t just knowledge—I offer direction, enthusiasm, and the will to grow."*
